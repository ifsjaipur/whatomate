```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.21+
- Node.js 18+
- PostgreSQL 14+
- Redis 6+
- Docker & Docker Compose (optional)

### Development Setup

1. **Clone and configure**:
   ```bash
   cd whatomate
   cp config.example.toml config.toml
   # Edit config.toml with your settings
   ```

2. **Start backend**:
   ```bash
   # Install dependencies
   go mod download

   # Run database migrations
   make migrate

   # Start the server (includes 1 embedded worker by default)
   make run

   # Or run with more workers for higher throughput
   go run cmd/server/main.go -workers=3

   # Or disable embedded workers (run workers separately)
   go run cmd/server/main.go -workers=0
   ```

3. **Start frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

### Docker Setup

```bash
cd docker
docker compose up -d
```

Access the application at `http://localhost:3000`

#### Scaling Workers

For high-volume campaign processing, you can scale the worker service:

```bash
# Run with 3 worker instances
docker compose up -d --scale worker=3
```

Workers use Redis Streams consumer groups, ensuring each job is processed by exactly one worker.

### Default Admin Login

When you run migrations for the first time, a default admin user is created:

- **Email**: `admin@admin.com`
- **Password**: `admin`

> **Important**: Change this password immediately after first login via the Profile page.

## Configuration

Copy `config.example.toml` to `config.toml` and update the values:

```toml
[app]
name = "Whatomate"
environment = "development"
debug = true

[server]
host = "0.0.0.0"
port = 8080

[database]
host = "localhost"
port = 5432
user = "whatomate"
password = "your-password"
name = "whatomate"
ssl_mode = "disable"

[redis]
host = "localhost"
port = 6379
password = ""
db = 0

[jwt]
secret = "your-jwt-secret"
access_token_expiry = "15m"
refresh_token_expiry = "7d"

[whatsapp]
api_version = "v18.0"
webhook_verify_token = "your-webhook-verify-token"

[ai]
openai_api_key = ""
anthropic_api_key = ""
google_api_key = ""
```

## Worker Service

The worker service handles bulk campaign message processing using Redis Streams for reliable job queuing.

### Architecture

```
┌─────────────┐     Redis Streams      ┌─────────────┐
│   Server    │ ─────────────────────► │  Worker 1   │
│  (enqueue)  │   whatomate:campaigns  ├─────────────┤
└─────────────┘         │              │  Worker 2   │
                        └─────────────►│  Worker N   │
                                       └─────────────┘
```

### Features

- **Reliable Processing**: Jobs persist in Redis until acknowledged
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Add more workers to increase throughput
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Workers complete current job before stopping
- **Automatic Recovery**: Stale jobs are reclaimed on worker startup

### Running Workers

**Embedded Mode** (default): The server runs workers internally.

```bash
# Default: 1 worker
./whatomate

# Run with 3 embedded workers
./whatomate -workers=3

# Disable embedded workers
./whatomate -workers=0
```

**Standalone Mode**: Run workers as separate processes.

```bash
# Run standalone worker
go run cmd/worker/main.go

# Or with Docker Compose
docker compose up -d --scale worker=3
```

## Role-Based Access Control

The platform supports three user roles with different permission levels:

| Feature | Admin | Manager | Agent |
|---------|-------|---------|-------|
| User Management | Full | None | None |
| Account Settings | Full | Full | None |
| Contacts | Full | Full | Assigned only |
| Messages | Full | Full | Assigned only |
| Templates | Full | Full | None |
| Flows | Full | Full | None |
| Campaigns | Full | Full | None |
| Chatbot Settings | Full | Full | None |
| Canned Responses | Full | Full | Use only |
| Analytics | Full | Full | None |

- **Admin**: Full access to all features including user management
- **Manager**: Full access except cannot manage users
- **Agent**: Can only chat with contacts assigned to them

## Conversation Flows

Conversation flows allow you to create multi-step automated conversations that collect information from users.

### Skip Conditions

Each step can have an optional **skip condition** that determines whether to skip the step based on previously collected data. If the condition evaluates to `true`, the step is skipped and the flow proceeds to the next step.

#### Syntax

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `==` | Equals | `status == 'confirmed'` |
| `!=` | Not equals | `phone != ''` (not empty) |
| `>` | Greater than | `amount > 1000` |
| `<` | Less than | `age < 18` |
| `>=` | Greater or equal | `count >= 5` |
| `<=` | Less or equal | `score <= 100` |
| `AND` | All conditions must be true | `name != '' AND phone != ''` |
| `OR` | Any condition can be true | `status == 'vip' OR amount > 1000` |
| `()` | Grouping | `(status == 'vip' OR amount > 100) AND name != ''` |

#### Examples

```
# Skip if phone already collected
phone != ''

# Skip if both name and email are provided
name != '' AND email != ''

# Skip for VIP users or high-value orders
status == 'vip' OR amount > 1000

# Complex condition with grouping
(status == 'vip' OR amount > 100) AND name != ''
```

#### Button Responses

When a user clicks a button, two variables are stored:
- `{store_as}` - The button ID (e.g., `btn_1`)
- `{store_as}_title` - The button text (e.g., `Yes`)

To check the button text in skip conditions, use the `_title` suffix:
```
# Check button text
choice_title == 'Yes'

# Check button ID
choice == 'btn_yes'

# Check if any button was clicked (not empty)
choice != ''
```
